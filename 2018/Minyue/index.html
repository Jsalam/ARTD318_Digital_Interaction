Empirical study of Fitts Law ... on grids
All the files in this example are available at github

Experiment design
The aim of this experiment is to define the best distribution of 5 clickable elements on the screen. By 'best' we mean the arrangement that affords the shortest time to click on all the elements in the sequence defined by their IDs. You can define their position, their size and their shape (either a rectanlge or circle). Overlaping elements are not allowed!

Grid
In the editing mode, the sandbox below provides a simple grid to help you layout the elements. Define number of columns with the slider above the canvas.
